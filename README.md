#### Description
Gaokao Benchmark aims to track how well we make progress towards human-level intelligence. It can not only provide a comprehensive evaluation of different tasks and domains that are practically useful in a real-world scenario, but also provide rich human performance so that AI systems can be
directly compared with humans over time.



### How to download Gaokao datasets?

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install datalabs

from datalabs import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("gaokao2018_np1", "listening")
```
where 
* `gaokao2018_np1` is a datasetname that represents the version of Gaokao (e.g., year). You can find all dataset and subdataset names
  [here](https://explainaboard.inspiredco.ai/datasets) 
* `listening` is a subdataset name that represents question type in Gaokao. You can find all question types [here](xx)
